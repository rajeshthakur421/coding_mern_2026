/*a Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a pattern used to reuse component logic. 
An HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with
 enhanced capabilities. This pattern is similar to higher-order functions in 
 JavaScript, which are functions that take other functions as arguments.*/
